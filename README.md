## Game Rules

Minesweeper is a game of strategy and deduction. The game board consists of a grid of tiles, some of which contain hidden mines. The objective is to uncover all the tiles that do not contain mines without triggering a mine.

Here are the basic rules of the game:

1. ❓ Left-click on a tile to reveal its content.
2. 💣 If the tile contains a mine, the game is over.
3. 🧮 If the tile does not contain a mine, it will display a number indicating how many adjacent tiles contain mines.
4. 🚩 Right-click on a tile to flag it as a potential mine.
5. 🤔 Use the numbers to deduce the locations of the mines and clear the board without triggering any mines.

## Features

The Minesweeper game includes the following features:

- 🎯 Interactive gameplay with a sleek and modern user interface.
- 😓 Variable board sizes to accommodate different difficulty levels.
- 🎲 Randomized mine placement for each new game.
- ⏱️ Timer to keep track of the player's progress.
